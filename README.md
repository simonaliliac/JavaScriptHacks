# JavaScriptHacks
Word *hacks* may sound cool, but those are more like fixes, tweaks and workarounds rather than classic hacking tools... ;)

## Projects
**PureURLtoFORM**: simple script for situations when you need to send website URL link in form, but URL should be without params.

**Wordpress - bio**: workaround for using more/less buttons within *bio* section.
